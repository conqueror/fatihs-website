# Performance Monitoring Guide for fatihnayebi.com

This guide outlines how to monitor and continuously improve the performance of the website.

## Tools for Performance Monitoring

### 1. Lighthouse Audits

Run regular Lighthouse audits to track performance metrics:

```bash
# Using Lighthouse CLI
npm install -g lighthouse
lighthouse https://fatihnayebi.com --view
```

Alternatively, use Chrome DevTools (Lighthouse tab) for on-demand audits.

### 2. WebPageTest

For in-depth analysis:
- Visit [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)
- Test from multiple locations and devices
- Focus on key metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

### 3. Core Web Vitals Report

Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console:
1. Open [Google Search Console](https://search.console.google.com/)
2. Navigate to "Core Web Vitals" report
3. Review LCP, FID, and CLS metrics

## What to Monitor

### Key Performance Metrics

1. **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: < 100ms is excellent, < 300ms is good
2. **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.8s is good, < 1s is excellent
3. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s is good, < 1.5s is excellent
4. **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms is good, < 50ms is excellent
5. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1 is good, < 0.05 is excellent
6. **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: < 300ms is good, < 150ms is excellent

### Page Size and Requests

Monitor the following with each deployment:
- Total page size (aim for < 1MB)
- Number of requests (aim for < 50)
- JavaScript bundle size (aim for < 150KB)
- CSS size (aim for < 50KB)
- Image size (optimize all to < 100KB each when possible)

## Performance Budget

Establish a performance budget and prevent regressions:

```
// Example budget.json
{
  "resourceSizes": [
    {
      "resourceType": "document",
      "budget": 20
    },
    {
      "resourceType": "script",
      "budget": 150
    },
    {
      "resourceType": "stylesheet",
      "budget": 50
    },
    {
      "resourceType": "image",
      "budget": 300
    },
    {
      "resourceType": "font",
      "budget": 100
    }
  ],
  "timings": [
    {
      "metric": "interactive",
      "budget": 3000
    },
    {
      "metric": "first-contentful-paint",
      "budget": 1500
    },
    {
      "metric": "largest-contentful-paint",
      "budget": 2500
    }
  ]
}
```

## Automated Monitoring Tools

### 1. SpeedCurve

- Set up [SpeedCurve](https://www.speedcurve.com/) for continuous monitoring
- Create alerts for performance regressions
- Benchmark against competitors

### 2. Calibre

- Use [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/) for performance monitoring
- Get detailed reports on Core Web Vitals
- Configure Slack alerts for issues

### 3. Pingdom

- Set up [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/) for uptime and response time monitoring
- Configure alerts for downtime or slow responses

## Performance Checklist Before Deployment

Before each deployment, verify:

1. **Images are optimized**
   - Use WebP format with fallbacks
   - Properly sized for different viewports
   - Use responsive images with srcset

2. **CSS is optimized**
   - Critical CSS is inlined
   - Non-critical CSS is deferred
   - Unused CSS is eliminated

3. **JavaScript is optimized**
   - Code-split into appropriate chunks
   - Defer non-critical JS
   - Use modern, smaller polyfills

4. **Fonts are optimized**
   - Self-hosted where possible
   - Use `font-display: swap`
   - Subset fonts when appropriate

5. **Server optimizations**
   - Proper caching headers
   - Gzip/Brotli compression enabled
   - HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 enabled

## Continuous Improvement Process

1. **Weekly review**
   - Check performance monitoring tools
   - Analyze real user metrics
   - Identify top issues to address

2. **Monthly deep-dive**
   - Run full Lighthouse audit
   - Compare with previous month
   - Update performance roadmap

3. **Quarterly planning**
   - Set performance goals for next quarter
   - Plan major performance initiatives
   - Review and update performance budget
