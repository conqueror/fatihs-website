# Profile Image Optimization Plan

## Phase 1: Analysis and Measurement

- [x] **Identify profile image usage throughout the site**
  - [x] Find all components using profile images
  - [x] Document current implementation details
  - [x] Verify current image paths and formats

- [x] **Measure current performance**
  - [x] Run Lighthouse audit focusing on image metrics
  - [x] Analyze network waterfall for image loading
  - [x] Check browser rendering timeline for layout shifts

- [x] **Define image requirements for each viewport**
  - [x] Mobile portrait (320-480px width)
  - [x] Tablet (481-768px width)
  - [x] Desktop (769px+)
  - [x] Determine ideal aspect ratios and crops for each viewport

## Phase 2: Image Processing Automation

- [x] **Enhance image optimization script**
  - [x] Add support for generating "art directed" crops for profile images
  - [x] Implement automatic focal point detection or manual focal point setting
  - [x] Create both WebP and AVIF versions for each crop
  - [x] Generate appropriate image sizes (e.g., 1x, 2x for each viewport)

- [x] **Update build pipeline**
  - [x] Integrate enhanced image optimization into build process
  - [x] Add validation to ensure all required variants exist
  - [x] Implement image dimensions metadata storage

## Phase 3: Component Implementation

- [x] **Create responsive profile image component**
  - [x] Implement `<picture>` element with appropriate sources
  - [x] Add proper `srcset` and `sizes` attributes
  - [x] Ensure proper width/height attributes to prevent layout shifts
  - [x] Add native lazy loading for offscreen instances
  - [x] Implement blur-up loading technique with low-res placeholders

- [x] **Update existing components**
  - [x] Replace current image implementations with the new component
  - [x] Verify correct functioning across viewports
  - [x] Test with browser viewport emulation

## Phase 4: Testing and Optimization

- [ ] **Performance testing**
  - [ ] Run Lighthouse tests to verify improvements
  - [ ] Test on actual devices with throttled connections
  - [ ] Verify behavior across different browsers
  - [ ] Measure bandwidth savings and load time improvements

- [ ] **Fine-tuning**
  - [ ] Adjust image quality and size thresholds as needed
  - [ ] Optimize loading priority for critical images
  - [ ] Validate edge cases (orientation changes, etc.)
  - [ ] Document final approach for future reference

## Phase 5: Documentation and Standards

- [ ] **Document the implementation**
  - [ ] Create documentation for the responsive image component
  - [ ] Document the image processing pipeline
  - [ ] Update content guidelines for future image additions

- [ ] **Establish standards**
  - [ ] Define image quality standards for the site
  - [ ] Create a checklist for adding new images
  - [ ] Set up automated quality checks
