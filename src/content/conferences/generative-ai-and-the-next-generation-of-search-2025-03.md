## Talk: *Generative AI and the Next Generation of Search*

Fatih Nayebi joined a panel at **Shoptalk 2025** to examine how large language models (LLMs) and generative AI are **reimagining the future of search**.

Fatih shed light on the implications of this next-generation search for consumer-facing brands, explaining how AI-driven search can help shoppers find products in more intuitive ways. *"Nothing significantly disrupted that fundamental experience…until now,"* the session emphasized, as AI opens opportunities to make search more conversational and personalized.
