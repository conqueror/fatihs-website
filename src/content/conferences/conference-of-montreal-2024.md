# Conference of Montreal 2024 - 30th Anniversary – Montreal, QC (2024)

## Panel: *Decision Making in the Digital Age*

Fatih Nayebi joined a panel discussion at Conference of Montreal organized by International Economic Forum of the Americas. Representing the ALDO Group and McGill University - Desautels Faculty of Management, he had the privilege of diving into the crucial topic of decision-making in the digital age.

The panel explored the transformative potential of AI in crisis response, emphasizing its ability to process data, identify trends, and model outcomes, enabling organizations to anticipate and mitigate risks effectively. However, they emphasized that the effectiveness of AI hinges on human oversight. The conversation highlighted the importance of human judgment, ethics, and experience in leveraging AI responsibly.

AI brings significant opportunities and challenges. It can rapidly analyze data, uncover hidden patterns, and predict future scenarios, leading to timely and effective interventions during crises. However, AI systems can be opaque and prone to biases, raising concerns about accountability and fairness. The panel agreed that ensuring AI complements human decision-making is crucial.

Despite these challenges, AI can be a pivotal solution when used responsibly. By combining AI with human expertise, organizations can enhance their ability to respond to emergencies while maintaining ethical standards and human-centric values.

The session was honored by the presence of Éric Caire, the Minister of CyberSecurity and Technology, who made a great introduction to the topic, setting the stage for the discussion.

Fatih was joined by a panel of experts:
- Chad Lesch, Senior Vice President of Strategic Projects at Crisis24
- Andrew Eppich, Country Manager at Equinix Canada
- Charles Morgan, Partner at McCarthy Tétrault
- Marie-Astrid Dubant, CFRM, Executive Director of CyberCap, who moderated the panel excellently

The discussion raised key questions:
- How can AI enhance human decision-making in crises?
- What human factors are critical to ensure safety in a world co-piloted by AI?
- What are the challenges and opportunities for effective crisis mitigation?

The panelists engaged in a thoughtful exchange of ideas and perspectives, providing valuable insights into the intersection of technology, leadership, and crisis management in today's digital landscape.
