# Big Data & AI Toronto 2023 â€“ Toronto, ON (2023)

## Talk: *Unleashing the Power of Generative AI for Tabular Data in Machine Learning Applications*

Fatih presented an expert session at **Big Data & AI Toronto 2023** on novel uses of generative AI for tabular data. He delved into how Generative AI techniques can create synthetic data to improve supervised machine learning models. Key topics included using generative models to augment training datasets for better classification/regression performance, transforming categorical variables into meaningful continuous embeddings to boost model accuracy, and automatically generating new features to reveal hidden patterns in data. Fatih also demonstrated how generative simulations assist in exploratory data analysis by identifying trends and outliers that might be missed otherwise. This talk empowered attendees with cutting-edge knowledge and practical techniques to harness generative AI in real-world data science projects, inspiring them to **"stay ahead of the curve"** in applying AI for data-driven innovation.
