## üìñ Foreword

**By Professor Alain Abran, Ph.D., Ing.**
*Emeritus Professor, Department of Software Engineering and IT, √âcole de technologie sup√©rieure (√âTS), Montr√©al*

> When I first met Fatih as a doctoral candidate in software engineering, his curiosity was already leaning toward the then‚Äënascent field of machine learning. Back then, discussions of autonomous agents and large‚Äëscale AI systems were still largely confined to research seminars and speculative conferences; few imagined the sweeping industrial impact we witness today. Yet Fatih was convinced‚Äîeven then‚Äîthat rigorous engineering principles could (and should) underpin intelligent systems long before "AI" became a ubiquitous business acronym.
>
> ...This book you are about to read is not merely a technical manual, though it abounds in architectural blueprints, code examples, and implementation guides. Nor is it purely an industry playbook, though retail leaders will find it invaluable for translating AI hype into operational advantage. It is, instead, a bridge‚Äîbetween scientific rigor and real‚Äëworld applicability, between the enduring principles codified in the SWEBOK and the frontier concepts now reshaping commerce through autonomous agents.
>
> ...Retail may seem, at first glance, an unlikely vanguard for Agentic AI. Yet few industries present a richer tapestry of real‚Äëtime signals‚Äîprices, inventories, customer behaviors, supply‚Äëchain events‚Äîdemanding rapid, decentralized decisions. Fatih's choice of retail as a proving ground is therefore inspired: it exposes every limitation of monolithic, rule‚Äëbased software and makes a compelling case for autonomous, collaborative agents governed by clear objectives, guardrails, and feedback loops.
>
> ...Fatih has delivered a timely, authoritative, and engaging work. It is a testament to his evolution from inquisitive graduate student to industry leader and educator, and it reflects the very principles we strived to instill: intellectual curiosity, methodological rigor, and an unwavering focus on practical impact.
>
> I invite you, the reader, to dig into these pages with both critical attention and creative imagination. May you emerge not only informed but inspired to engineer the next generation of intelligent systems‚Äîsystems that honor the best traditions of our discipline while venturing boldly into new frontiers.

## ‚úçÔ∏è From the Author: Preface Highlights

**A Meeting of Theory and Practice**

> The retail industry is in a period of unprecedented upheaval... As artificial intelligence (AI) emerges from research labs and enters the mainstream, retailers grapple with a wave of new possibilities... Yet, for every promising pilot project, there remains a wide chasm between conceptual experimentation and fully realized, at-scale Agentic AI solutions.
>
> ...While the term "Agentic AI" has found its way into research papers and conference keynotes, the practical guidance for deploying such systems in the dynamic realm of retail remains sparse.
>
> **Why Now?** We stand at a pivotal moment. The retail industry faces surging expectations... Traditional methods...are buckling under the weight of these expectations. Meanwhile, AI-driven breakthroughs...have given us the technical tools needed to build more adaptive and self-sufficient systems.
>
> This book aims to fill that void, offering a step-by-step journey through the fundamentals of agent design, decision frameworks, multi-agent coordination, and end‚Äëto‚Äëend integrations for real‚Äëworld retail contexts.
>
> **My Journey and Aspirations:** My path to writing *Foundations of Agentic AI for Retail* has been shaped by a career spent at the crossroads of enterprise technology, academic research, and practical product development... My hope is that these pages demystify Agentic AI and act as a catalyst‚Äîmoving you from proofs‚Äëof‚Äëconcept to production, from tactical wins to strategic transformation. Done well, autonomous agents don't replace humans; they free us to focus on creativity and strategy.
