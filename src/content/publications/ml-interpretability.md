## Abstract

The black-box nature of many state-of-the-art machine learning models poses significant challenges for their adoption in clinical settings, where interpretability is essential for trust and actionable insights. In this paper, we present a novel framework for developing inherently interpretable machine learning models specifically designed for clinical decision support. Our approach balances predictive performance with interpretability through a combination of sparse feature selection, hierarchical attention mechanisms, and case-based reasoning. We evaluate our framework on three real-world clinical datasets and demonstrate that our interpretable models achieve comparable performance to black-box models while providing clinically meaningful explanations.

## Key Contributions

1. Development of a hybrid interpretability framework that combines model-intrinsic and post-hoc explanation methods
2. Introduction of a novel clinical relevance scoring mechanism that aligns model explanations with domain knowledge
3. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple clinical domains including cardiology, oncology, and emergency medicine
4. User studies with 42 healthcare professionals demonstrating increased trust and actionability of the system's recommendations

## Impact

This work addresses a critical gap in clinical AI applications by providing a systematic approach to interpretable machine learning that meets the unique requirements of healthcare environments. By enabling clinicians to understand model predictions, our framework facilitates responsible deployment of AI in clinical workflows, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning while maintaining appropriate human oversight.
