## Summary

This paper presents a comprehensive review of mobile application usability evaluation methods and techniques. With the rapid growth of mobile applications, understanding how to effectively evaluate their usability has become increasingly important. The research analyzes various evaluation approaches, comparing their effectiveness across different contexts and application types. This work has become a foundational reference in the field of mobile usability research, cited by over 400 subsequent studies.

## Key Insights

1. Traditional usability evaluation methods developed for desktop applications require significant adaptation for mobile contexts
2. Mobile usability evaluation must account for unique constraints including limited screen size, variable connectivity, and diverse interaction methods
3. Context of use is a critical factor in mobile usability evaluation, with significant differences between lab-based and field-based testing approaches
4. A combination of automated testing, expert evaluation, and user testing provides the most comprehensive assessment of mobile application usability
5. Mobile-specific heuristics offer more effective guidance than general usability principles when evaluating mobile applications

## Impact

This research has influenced the development of mobile-specific usability guidelines and evaluation frameworks across both academic and industry settings. By establishing a taxonomy of mobile usability evaluation methods, the work provides researchers and practitioners with a structured approach to selecting appropriate evaluation techniques based on their specific requirements and constraints. The paper's insights have helped shape mobile application development practices, contributing to improved user experiences in mobile software.
