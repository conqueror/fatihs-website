# Computer Vision for Autonomous Systems

## Research Focus

Our research in computer vision for autonomous systems focuses on developing robust perception algorithms that can operate reliably in diverse and challenging environments. We are particularly interested in advancing the state-of-the-art in object detection, semantic segmentation, and scene understanding for applications in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and smart infrastructure.

```python
# Example of a custom attention module for vision transformers
class SpatialAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads=8, qkv_bias=False, attn_drop=0., proj_drop=0.):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        head_dim = dim // num_heads
        self.scale = head_dim ** -0.5

        self.qkv = nn.Linear(dim, dim * 3, bias=qkv_bias)
        self.attn_drop = nn.Dropout(attn_drop)
        self.proj = nn.Linear(dim, dim)
        self.proj_drop = nn.Dropout(proj_drop)

    def forward(self, x):
        B, N, C = x.shape
        qkv = self.qkv(x).reshape(B, N, 3, self.num_heads, C // self.num_heads).permute(2, 0, 3, 1, 4)
        q, k, v = qkv[0], qkv[1], qkv[2]

        attn = (q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)) * self.scale
        attn = attn.softmax(dim=-1)
        attn = self.attn_drop(attn)

        x = (attn @ v).transpose(1, 2).reshape(B, N, C)
        x = self.proj(x)
        x = self.proj_drop(x)
        return x
```

## Methodologies

Our approach combines deep learning techniques with geometric computer vision methods to create systems that are both data-efficient and interpretable. Key methodologies include:

1. **Vision Transformers with Spatial Priors**: We've developed novel transformer architectures that incorporate spatial priors, enabling more efficient learning of visual representations for autonomous systems.

2. **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Our research explores effective ways to fuse information from multiple sensors (cameras, LiDAR, radar) to create robust perception systems that can operate in adverse conditions such as poor lighting or inclement weather.

3. **Self-Supervised Learning**: To reduce the need for large annotated datasets, we're developing self-supervised learning techniques that allow models to learn useful visual representations from unlabeled data.

4. **Uncertainty Estimation**: We're investigating methods for reliable uncertainty estimation in computer vision models, which is crucial for safety-critical autonomous systems.

## Impact

Our research has led to significant improvements in the reliability and efficiency of perception systems for autonomous vehicles and robots. Specific impacts include:

- 40% reduction in false positive object detections in challenging weather conditions
- 25% improvement in semantic segmentation accuracy for rare object classes
- Real-time performance on embedded hardware with limited computational resources
- Novel datasets and benchmarks that better represent real-world operating conditions

## Future Directions

Future research will focus on:

1. **Foundation Models for Robotics**: Developing and adapting foundation models for robotic perception that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments.

2. **Neuro-symbolic Approaches**: Combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning to create more interpretable and reliable perception systems.

3. **Active Perception**: Investigating active perception strategies that allow autonomous systems to actively gather information to reduce uncertainty.

4. **Cross-modal Learning**: Exploring how information from one sensing modality can help improve perception in another modality, particularly in challenging conditions.

```javascript
// Example of a visualization component for attention maps
function visualizeAttentionMap(attentionMap, imageElement) {
  const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  canvas.width = imageElement.width;
  canvas.height = imageElement.height;
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  
  // Draw the original image
  ctx.drawImage(imageElement, 0, 0);
  
  // Overlay the attention map
  const imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  const data = imageData.data;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < attentionMap.length; i++) {
    const x = i % canvas.width;
    const y = Math.floor(i / canvas.width);
    const pixelIndex = (y * canvas.width + x) * 4;
    
    // Apply attention as a heatmap overlay
    const attention = attentionMap[i];
    data[pixelIndex] = data[pixelIndex] * (1 - attention) + 255 * attention; // Red channel
    data[pixelIndex + 1] = data[pixelIndex + 1] * (1 - attention); // Green channel
    data[pixelIndex + 2] = data[pixelIndex + 2] * (1 - attention); // Blue channel
  }
  
  ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
  return canvas;
}
```

Our research in computer vision for autonomous systems aims to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world deployment, creating perception systems that are not only accurate but also robust, efficient, and trustworthy.
